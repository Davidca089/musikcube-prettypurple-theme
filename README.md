## About
Very simple (and very purple) theme for Musikcube (I slapped white, black and purple together ðŸ˜Ž).


Feel free to use this thing as a template for your colorscheme.

## Installation
1. Clone the repo.
2. Copy the .json file to `~/.config/musikcube/themes/`.
3. Enable `PrettyPurple` in the `color theme` option inside Musikcube.

Disable the `degrade to 256 color palette` option from Musikcube for it to work.

## Notes
Musikcube is a terminal-based audio engine, library, player and server.
